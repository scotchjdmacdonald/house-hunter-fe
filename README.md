# Check out [House Hunter](http://househunterfe.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/#/)!

### Application I built whilst looking for an apartment in Amsterdam with my partner.

### Got a bit sick of having to look on different websites all the time ðŸ˜‰.

Simple [Vue Cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/) front end, talks to [Nodejs/Typescript Backend](https://github.com/scotchjdmacdonald/house-hunter)

Using vue framework [VueSax](https://github.com/lusaxweb/vuesax).

Built and deployed using [Travis CI](travis-ci.org), hosted in [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket with static site hosting.
